<-----------------------Description-------------------->
The files included in the allDissim folder consists of all the simulated hippocampal networks obtained via the description
provided in the following:

	Paper: Persistent Homology of Asymmetric Networks: An Approach based on Dowker Filtrations
	Authors: Samir Chowdhury, Facundo M\'emoli
	arxiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05432

All networks here are normalized to have entries between 0 and 1.

Naming convention: 
<t>_<dissim>_<numHoles>_<numTrial>

- The "t_" prefix means that these networks have been truncated, i.e. they have between 150 and 200 nodes.
- numHoles refers to the number of holes in the arena from which this network was generated (between 0 and 4).
- numTrial refers to the number of the trial (between 1 and 20).
